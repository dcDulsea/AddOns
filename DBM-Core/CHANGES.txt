    Disable the swap warning on Court, because it's kind of fight that the less you swap the better, it's one of those things it's better DBM doesn't try to automate for you. Plus since i'm no longer anyones main tank, i'm not really in a position to know these numbers anymore anyways, so it makes sense to just remove the tank swap warning.
    Changed aggregation on sivara to be even more lose. it'll mean even slower personal warning when color changes, but also less likely to double warn/double yell when you're just clearing your stacks.
